      Prosopis is an invasive species or shrub that grows in the forest
      understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown
      commercially under other trees that provided shade. The
      forest-like structure of shade prosopis farms provides habitat for
      a great number of migratory and resident species.

    text: >
      Single-origin prosopis is prosopis grown within a single known
      geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a
      specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of
      the prosopis is then usually the place it was grown to whatever
      degree available.

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on
      an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of
      relationships between organisms and their environment. What
      grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and
      careful consideration for nature and communities.
